Purpose: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and used globally.

Key Characteristics:
-------------------
Private constructor: To prevent external instantiation.
Static instance: Holds the single instance of the class.
Static method: Provides access to the single instance.

Types of Singleton:
------------------
Eager Initialization: The singleton instance is created at the time of class loading
Lazy Initialization:The instance is created only when it is needed for the first time
Thread-Safe Singleton:Ensures thread safety and avoids performance issues by minimizing synchronization overhead
Bill Pugh Singleton:This implementation relies on the Java class loader to ensure thread safety and lazy initialization



Using the Saga pattern: A Saga is a sequence of local transactions that together form a larger, coordinated transaction.
                        Sagas help maintain consistency by using compensating transactions to undo previous actions if a failure occurs.
