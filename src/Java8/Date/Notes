-> In java we have java.util.Date class to work with date related functionality in our
application.
Date date = new Date();
-> When we create object for Date class it will give both date and time (current date &
time).
-> If we want to get only date without time or only time without date then we have to write
our own logic using Date class object.
-> To overcome this problem, in java 1.8 v changes happened for Date API.
-> In Java 1.8v new classes provided to work with date related functionality
    java.time.LocalDate (It will deal with only date)
    java.time.LocalTime (It will deal with only time)
    java.time.LocalDateTime (It will deal with both date & time)
-> The above classes got introduced in java.time package
