About your project and daily tasks.
-----------------------------------
"In my current project, I am working on migrating microservices from an old server to a new one. My daily tasks involve designing and implementing
 microservices using Spring Boot, developing RESTful APIs, managing the database with JPA/Hibernate, writing unit tests with JUnit and Mockito, and
 deploying services to a cloud environment, specifically the Gaia server, which is exclusive to JPMC. I also participate in code reviews, pair programming,
  and daily stand-ups to ensure seamless progress."

You mentioned you worked on microservices; can you elaborate?
------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I have experience in designing, developing, and deploying microservices. I have worked on breaking down a monolithic application into smaller,
independent microservices that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice handled a specific business capability and
communicated with others through RESTful APIs or message queues. This architecture improved our system's scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.
