In Java 8, the double colon (::) operator is called method references.
There are four kinds of method references:

Reference to a static method ClassName::staticMethodName
Reference to an instance method of a particular object Object::instanceMethodName
Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type ContainingType::methodNameâ€“
Reference to a constructor ClassName::new
