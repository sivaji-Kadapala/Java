Q) What is the advantage of having Default & Static methods in java 8?
-> Default & Static methods provides backward compatibility.
-> For example, if several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface Test then if
   we add a new method to the Test, we have to change the code in all the classes (A, B, C and
   D) that implements this interface.
-> In this example we have only four classes that implements the interface, but imagine if
there are hundreds of classes implementing an interface it will become very difficult to
change all the classes which are implementing that interface. This is why in java 8, we have a
new concept “default methods”.
